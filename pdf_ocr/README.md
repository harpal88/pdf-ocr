Scanned PDF Data Extraction Engine
..............
Overview
''''''''''''''''
The Scanned PDF Data Extraction Engine is a Python-based application designed to extract data from scanned PDF documents. This project tackles challenges such as varying zoom levels, document angles, noise, and text variations to ensure accurate data extraction. The extracted data is then stored in an SQL database, and the engine includes API endpoints for secure and efficient data handling.

Features
''''''''''''
PDF Data Extraction: Handles scanned PDFs, compensating for zoom, angle, and noise.
Data Storage: Utilizes an SQL database to store the extracted data.
API Integration: Provides endpoints for uploading PDFs and retrieving data.
Error Handling: Ensures high accuracy with robust error handling and preprocessing.
Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language used for developing the extraction engine.
SQL: Database management system for storing extracted data.
JSON: For configuring data field mappings and extraction rules.
